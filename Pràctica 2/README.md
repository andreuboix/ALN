Pr√†ctica 2: 
MATLAB. 
- Calculus of the q+1 coeffs a_{q}, a_{q-1},...a_{1}x,a_{0} of the polynomial p of degree q (q<m), that aproximates these values by a quadratic model of (x_{1},x_{2},...x_{m}), (f(x_{1}) =y_{1}, y_{2}, ..., y_{m}).
- QR Decomposition of an A Matrix using the Modified Gram-Schmidt Algorithm (MG-SA).
- 2-Norm of the residual vector, norm2Res = || Aa - y||_{2}, a = coeffs vector of p.
